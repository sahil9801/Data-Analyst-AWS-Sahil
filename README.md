AWS Service Case Studies
This section provides a detailed reflection on how the core AWS services utilized in this project align with the foundational concepts and practical labs demonstrated in your cloud computing modules, as evidenced by the provided screenshots. For a visual representation of these concepts, you can refer to the diagrams created using draw.io.
AWS Deployment and Service Models (Module 1)
As seen in Image 10, the comparison between "Traditional Computing Model vs Cloud Computing Model" and "Cloud Deployment Models" highlights the fundamental shift to cloud computing. Your project's deployment of EC2, S3, and Glue DataBrew on AWS exemplifies the public cloud model, leveraging its inherent scalability and cost-efficiency. The use of EC2 as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and S3/Glue DataBrew as Platform as a Service (PaaS)/Serverless demonstrates a strategic blend of service models to achieve optimal control and operational simplicity.
AWS Cost Analysis and Optimization (Module 2)
Image 8 and Image 9 prominently feature "AWS Pricing Calculator" and "AWS Support Plan" sections. Your project's detailed S3 cost analysis ($0.02 USD monthly) directly reflects the principles of cost optimization taught in this module. By choosing serverless architectures and optimizing storage, you've achieved significant cost savings, a key outcome of understanding AWS's pay-as-you-go model and utilizing tools for cost estimation and management.
AWS Global Infrastructure (Module 3)
Image 7 showcases the "AWS Global Infrastructure" concepts. Your decision to deploy the platform in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) region directly benefits from the robust design of AWS's global network, which includes multiple isolated Availability Zones. This ensures high availability and fault tolerance for your academic data platform, minimizing downtime and enhancing resilience.
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) (Module 4)
Image 5 and Image 6 illustrate "Case Study: IAM Responsible" and "Lab 1: Introduction to AWS IAM." Your project's implementation of IAM Access Analyzer for S3 and the definition of granular access policies (as detailed in the IAM Access Matrix) are direct applications of this module's principles. IAM is crucial for securely controlling access to your AWS resources, ensuring that only authorized users and services can interact with sensitive academic data, thereby enforcing the principle of least privilege.
AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) (Module 5)
Image 3 and Image 4 depict "Case Study: Build your VPC Lab" and "Lab 2: Build your VPC and Launch a Web Server." The configuration of your dedicated VPC (Academic-Vol-SahilSharma with CIDR 172.31.0.0/16) is a core component of your infrastructure, providing a logically isolated and secure network environment. The experience gained from troubleshooting initial VPC configuration complexities and security group rules, as mentioned in your project report, directly reflects the practical challenges and solutions covered in this module.
AWS Lambda for Serverless Computing (Module 6)
Image 2 shows a "Case Study: AWS Lambda Lab." While your initial weekly reports focused on foundational services, the "Lambda Automation Workflow" in your project's future roadmap directly leverages Lambda's serverless capabilities. This service is ideal for event-driven automation, such as triggering data processing jobs upon S3 object creation, enabling a highly scalable and cost-efficient approach to pipeline orchestration.
AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) for Persistent Storage (Module 7)
Image 1 displays a "Case Study: Lab 1: Working with EBS." Your EC2 instance implicitly relies on EBS for persistent block-level storage. EBS volumes provide the necessary durability and performance for the operating system, applications, and any temporary data processed directly on your analytics EC2 cluster. The selection of gp3 volumes, as detailed in your EBS Performance Benchmark, ensures a balanced performance for your compute workloads.
